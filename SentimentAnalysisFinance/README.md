## Licensing, Acknowledgements
- This project was completed as part of the `Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree`. Data were provided by Udacity. The data was originally sourced by Udacity from Starbucks.
- The different techniques come from many different sources :
  - **deep learning models relying on a pre-trained embedding** (`https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification_with_hub`)
  - **RNN models** in order to take into account the context of the sentences (you could try to adapt the LSTM model implemented in the Deep Learning Specialization: `https://github.com/Kulbear/deep-learning-coursera/blob/master/Sequence%20Models/Emojify%20-%20v2.ipynb`)
