Last published Date: 2020 May 5th

## Introduction
I decided to follow the `Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program` because I was very eager to learn how to implement in practice end-to-end Machine Learning projects while learning coding best practices. You will find below the different projects completed during the term 2 of this program.

## Repo structure
`RecommendationEngineIBM` - Build a recommendation engine for articles on the IBM Watson platform
- Details: Implementation of the different types of recommendation: Rank Based Recommendations, User-User Based Collaborative Filtering, Content Based Recommendations and Collaborative Filtering with a matrix factorization technique called SVD
- Technological stacks: python, scikit-learn, pickle

`DisasterResponsePipeline` - Implementation of a text classification pipeline for Disaster Response
- Details: Implementation of different pipelines: an ETL pipeline to extract transform and load the data into a sqlite database, a Machine Learning Pipeline leveraging NLP techniques and a Flask application
- Technological stacks: python, scikit-learn, sqlalchemy, NLTK, flask

`CapstoneProject`: Personalize your promotion campaigns with a collaborative filtering approach based on FunkSVD algorithm
- Details: Implementation a recommendation engine based on FunkSVD algorithm and writing of an article in medium to give the main takeaways `https://medium.com/@henri.bouxin/personalize-you-promotion-campaigns-with-a-collaborative-filtering-approach-based-on-funksvd-71c33ec85f7a`
- Technological stacks: python

`Experiments`: Validation of the statistical significance of an AB test and optimization of a promotion campaign by implementing a classification supervised learning approach
- Details: Implementation of Student t-test to validation the significance of the validation metrics increase, and implement a Gradient Boosting Classifier to improve the promotion campaign financial efficiency
- Technological stacks: python, scikit-learn, statsmodels

`SentimentAnalysisFinance`: Implementation of a sentiment classifier for financial news
- Details: Showing how to power NLP classification task thanks to embeddings and recurrent neural networks, and writing of a medium post to share my understanding
- Technological stacks: python, scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow

`RecommendationEngineLessons` : Implementation of key takeaways functions and classes for an end-to-end recommendation engine

## Key takeaways :
- Learn data engineering (ETL and ML pipeline) and software engineering (object-oriented programming with class, building of a python package, deployment of a flask application) key ideas
- Learn the key ideas for building from scratch a recommendation engine
- Learn how to design an AB test and test for its statistical significance
- Learn to write medium posts in order to share your understanding and insights on some data science subjects
