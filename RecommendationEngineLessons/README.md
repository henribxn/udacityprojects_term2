Last published Date: 2020 May 5th

## Introduction
I decided to follow the `Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program` because I was very eager to learn how to implement in practice end-to-end Machine Learning projects while learning coding best practices. You will find below the different projects completed during the term 2 of this program.

## Repo structure
`RecommendationEngineIBM` - Build a recommendation engine for articles on the IBM Watson platform
- Details: Implementation of the different types of recommendation: Rank Based Recommendations, User-User Based Collaborative Filtering, Content Based Recommendations and Collaborative Filtering with a matrix factorization technique called SVD 
- Technological stacks: python, scikit-learn, pickle

`DisasterResponsePipeline` : Implementation of a Disaster Response pipeline leveraging Data Engineering, NLP and Machine Learning pipeline

`CapstoneProject`: Implementation of a collaborative filtering approach based on FunkSVD algorithm. In addition, I write a medium post giving the main details of the project

`Experiments`: Analyse of the statistical significance of an AB test and optimization of the promotion campaign by implementing a classification supervised learning approach

`RecommendationEngineLessons` : key takeaways functions and class to implement

`SentimentAnalysisFinance`: Writing a Data Science Blog Post on how to power NLP Classification tasks thanks to embeddings and recurrent neural networks

## Key takeaways :
- Learn how to implement an end-to-end Machine Learning Projects
- Learn how to efficiently use very common Machine Learning libraries & Deep Learning such as `scikit-learn` and `pytorch`
- Learn how to build a clean code with functions and classes, and argument parsing in order to call and execute your project from a command line
